# Neural-Network-Regressor
In this project we work with Spotify data to predict popularity of music tracks using a Neural Network Regressor.
First, we do some data pre-processing including Standardisation of numerical features and Encoding of categorical features, 
and finally we build different Regression Neural Network models (in Keras) to predict the poplarity of music tracks.
We use Early Stopping Callback and Dropout to prevent overfitting.
